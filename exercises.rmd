This notebooks is really all one big exercise: by viewing the HTML version of this (which is what you’re doing, right?), try to recreate the key components of this file on your own! Open the *.Rmd version of this file to see how things were made.

Remember to use the [cheat sheet](http://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf) to help!

# Step 1: Header
Set up the header. Set a value for the title, and your name. I like the date to be re-generated each time I knit the file, so I use a snippet of R code instead of writing in a date:

<code>date: &quot;&#96;r Sys.Date()&#96;&quot;</code>

Yes, the back-tick denoted code section goes inside normal quotes. Also note: creating the above literal snippet of a code block is difficult and not a normal thing to do unless you’re writing workshop materials. They way I’ve done it above is a hack. I wouldn’t try to replicate it as an exercise (I still haven’t figured out a good way to do it consistently).

Also, turn on a floating table of contents.

# Step 2: Sections

Make some sections in your document. Use different levels.

## This is a subsection

### This is a subsection

#### How far can we go? 

This level isn't in the table of contents anymore

##### Level 5!

# Step 3: Formatting, Links, Images, and HTML

*Italics*, **Bold**, and `verbatim` are all possible, but no underline.

We can make lists too! Be careful – spacing matters when you start a list.

- The Next Generation
- Deep Space Nine
- Original Series
- Enterprise
- Voyager

Links: [Google](www.google.com)

Any URL will also get converted to a link: http://www.google.com

Images can come from local files, or urls:

![](rainbow.png)

If you want to control image size, then it's best to use an HTML image tag instead: 

```
<img src="https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.png" style="width:200px">
```

<img src="https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.png" style="width:200px">

<u> I can get underline with html </u>

# Step 4: Code Chunks

```{r}
2+2
```

```{r}
hist(rnorm(100))
```

We can change figure sizes

```{r}
hist(rnorm(100))
```

Chunks that don't return anything wont' have output
```{r eval = FALSE}
x <- 4
```

While there are multiple lines with output, by default, your chunk will get split:

```{r}
mean(rnorm(100))
```

```{r}
sd(rnorm(100))
```

# Step 5: Chunk Options

```{r}
x<-10
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
x<-5
x
```

Above wasn't evaluated, so x will still be 10

```{r}
x
```


# Step 6: Formatting Output

We want our tables to look pretty. There are multiple options. I like datable from the DT package:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("DT")
```

```{r}
library(DT)
```

```{r}
mtcars %>% datatable() 
```

For static tables, try `kable`, or `stargazer` for regression output. 

# What else? 

A few parting thoughts.

Something that isn’t in this example file, but can be found in other *.Rmd exercise files for Research Computing workshops, is a paramter up top that is used to either include or exclude exercise answers. This is useful if you’re writing homework assignments, workshops, or if you want a version of your files with the code, and a different one with only the output.

You can knit RMarkdown documents by calling the `rmarkdown::render` function. (You don’t have to just hit the button.) See the `knitall.r` files in the [Intro to R workshop repo](https://github.com/nuitrcs/intro_r_workshop).

It’s often useful to put a chunk with your system information at the end of a file, so at least you know what version of everything was used, so that if it breaks in the future with updates, you have a chance to recover old versions.

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
